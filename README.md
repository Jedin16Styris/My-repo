#Bitcoin Price Forecasting with Deep Learning 📈
This project showcases a deep learning model designed to forecast short-term Bitcoin (BTC) price movements. Using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, the model analyzes historical price data to predict the closing prices for the next 8 hours (32 intervals of 15 minutes) and estimates the potential trading range.

This tool is intended to assist traders in making more informed decisions by providing data-driven insights into potential market trends.

🚀 Key Features
🧠 

Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a sophisticated LSTM network, which is particularly effective for time-series forecasting. 


⏱️ 

Intraday Forecasting: Predicts the next two 4-hour candles (an 8-hour period) in Bitcoin's intraday trading, providing short-term market outlooks. 


📊 

Trading Range Estimation: The model also estimates an approximate 8-hour trading range, offering a valuable tool for risk management. 


📈 

Rich Visualizations: The project includes clear and interactive charts built with Matplotlib and Plotly to visualize model performance and forecasts. 


🛠️ Tech Stack: Built with Python and leverages powerful libraries like TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Yahoo Finance (yfinance).
